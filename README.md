# the great race in the sky
intentionally low-budget 2d racecar game made for csc graphics course :)

written in java with JPanel (ouch) over the course of a few weeks. 

Features:
1. 2 player gameplay on one keyboard (p1 - arrows, p2 - wasd)
2. collision detection: funny falling and dirt slowdown
3. checkpoint system for laps: makes the players follow the intended loop!
4. allow player to choose how many laps
5. run over the other player!

Things i wish were different:
1. cant return to title
2. player speed tracked but not vector (oops), so collision between players could've been so much better
3. more tracks, funny sfx, and better models would have been fun if i had unlimited time
